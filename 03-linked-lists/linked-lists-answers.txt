1. Spacial locality refers to a practice of accessing pieces of data that are in close spacial proximity of each other,
and does not reference the values that have already been read. This is an advantageous practive when the data evaluated
is clustered together, and therefore there is no need to jump all around the memory, and the processes of looking something
up are performe linearly.
2. All the snapshots are attached with the results. When it comes to creating, arrays far exceed the linked list, but
when it comes to looking up, they are surprisingly close in performance. And likewise, when it comes to removing elements,
although the linked list is slightly outclassed when it comes to the search, the process after deletion greatly
outperforms a regular array, considering that an array has to shift all of the subsequent values.
